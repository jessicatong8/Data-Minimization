When companies are required to limit data collection to only what’s necessary and proportionate to clearly disclosed purposes, it reduces the risk of misuse or exploitation of personal information. It also gives consumers more control over their data and encourages ethical business practices. In a time when data privacy concerns are at an all-time high, this type of regulation is a necessary step toward responsible tech development.","Reevaluate what data they collect and ensure it's clearly tied to a disclosed and justified purpose.

Update privacy policies to reflect specific, understandable explanations for each type of data collected.

Build or revise consent mechanisms to align with these specific purposes, allowing users to opt in with full awareness.

Implement backend changes to restrict access to non-essential data across systems.

Train teams on the importance of data minimization and ensure compliance is integrated into the product lifecycle.

These changes may require extra effort upfront, but they foster a more respectful and secure environment for users and ultimately benefit companies through increased user trust and legal protection.",1,"I strongly agree because data minimization prioritizes consumer privacy and trust. With so many apps and platforms collecting excessive personal information—often beyond what’s needed for basic functionality—this regulation would create boundaries that help protect users. It encourages ethical data practices, reduces risk in the event of data breaches, and ensures that users aren’t unknowingly overexposed just by using everyday services. Limiting data collection to what is reasonable and expected also fosters transparency and makes companies more accountable for how they handle user information.","App developers may need to audit their current data collection practices and remove or revise any that are not strictly necessary for core functionality. This could involve:

Updating data collection policies and privacy notices.

Reconfiguring app permissions to avoid requesting unnecessary access (e.g., camera, contacts, location).

Implementing clearer consent mechanisms so users understand why data is collected.

Training development and product teams on privacy-by-design principles.

Limiting backend data storage and ensuring retention policies are reasonable.

In essence, developers would need to design apps with privacy in mind from the start—focusing only on what is needed to deliver the intended service effectively.",1,"I strongly agree because the regulation protects consumers by ensuring their personal data is only used for clear, necessary purposes directly tied to the product or service they requested. Too often, companies collect excessive or unrelated data that can be misused or mishandled, putting users at unnecessary risk. This regulation promotes user trust, limits the impact of data breaches, and encourages companies to be more transparent and intentional with how they handle personal information. It supports a balance between functionality and privacy, which is essential in today’s digital landscape.","App developers will likely need to:

Conduct audits to evaluate what data they collect and why.

Eliminate data collection that isn’t strictly necessary to provide or maintain the specific service requested.

Refactor permission requests so they align only with the features the user actively uses.

Improve transparency in their privacy policies and user onboarding to clearly communicate what data is collected and for what purpose.

Design systems that implement “privacy by design,” ensuring minimal data is collected from the start.

Set appropriate data retention limits, deleting personal data once it's no longer needed for the original purpose.

Overall, developers will need to be more intentional and user-focused in their data practices, shifting from a “collect everything just in case” mindset to a more ethical and privacy-conscious approach.",2,2,,2,1,,2,,627a65a2439f59544115d476,6806e80aa09de22ad716aebf,6806e9be908f3fa13e080e61,photo and video,YouTube

By disclosing the purpose of data collection, it allows users to understand what information is being gathered and why. This promotes accountability and empowers consumers to make informed decisions about their data privacy. Limiting collection to what is reasonably necessary and proportionate for that disclosed purpose prevents excessive data gathering.","App developers will need to:

Clearly and explicitly disclose data collection purposes: They will need to provide users with easily understandable explanations of why specific personal data is being collected. Vague or overly broad disclosures will likely not be sufficient.
Justify the necessity and proportionality of data collection: For each data point they collect, developers will need to demonstrate that it is genuinely needed and not excessive in relation to the stated purpose.
Implement data collection limitations: Their systems will need to be designed to prevent the collection of data that falls outside the disclosed purposes or is not reasonably necessary.
Regularly review and update data collection practices: As their apps evolve and new features are added, developers will need to ensure that their data collection practices continue to align with the disclosed purposes and the principles of necessity and proportionality.
Potentially offer more user control over data sharing: Providing users with more granular control over the types of data they share for specific purposes could be a way to enhance compliance and build trust.
Ensure disclosures are easily accessible and understandable: Privacy policies and in-app explanations of data collection practices will need to be clear, concise, and written in plain language that consumers can readily understand.





",1,"This definition of data minimization aligns with user-centric privacy principles. It emphasizes limiting data collection not just to a disclosed purpose, but to what a consumer would reasonably anticipate. This helps prevent companies from collecting data for vaguely defined or unexpected purposes, fostering greater trust and transparency in data handling practices. It puts the user's understanding and expectations at the forefront of data collection limitations.","App developers will need to:

Focus on user expectations: They will need to carefully consider what data a typical user would reasonably expect them to collect in order to provide the app's features and services.
Justify data collection based on expectations: The rationale for collecting specific data points will need to be clearly linked to what users would anticipate as part of the app's functionality.
Review and potentially limit secondary data collection: Data collection for purposes beyond the core functionality that users would expect might need to be significantly limited or eliminated.
Enhance transparency about data usage: Developers will need to clearly explain to users why specific data is being collected in a way that aligns with their likely expectations.
Potentially offer more granular privacy controls: Giving users more control over the types of data collected, based on their understanding of the app's purpose, could become necessary.
Conduct user research: Understanding user expectations regarding data collection for different app features might require user surveys or testing.",1,"Limiting data collection to what is reasonably necessary and proportionate to provide a specific service requested by the consumer aligns with principles of privacy and user control. It ensures that companies are not collecting excessive amounts of personal data that may not be essential for the service provided, reducing the potential for misuse or security breaches. This focused approach respects user autonomy and promotes trust.","App developers will likely need to:

Clearly define and justify data collection: They will need to identify the specific personal data required to provide each requested service and articulate why that data is necessary.
Implement granular data collection: They might need to implement systems that allow for the collection of only the data needed for a particular feature or service when that feature or service is actively being used or requested.
Review existing data collection practices: Developers will need to audit their current apps to identify any instances where they are collecting data that is not strictly necessary to provide a user-requested service.
Provide transparency to users: They will need to clearly inform users about the specific data being collected for each service they request.
Potentially redesign features: In some cases, app features might need to be redesigned to function effectively with less data collection.

Redesign onboarding and permissions flows to align with specific, disclosed purposes.",1,In modern times consumer privacy requires data minimization as a protective measure. The collection of data should be restricted to essential and pertinent information to prevent data breaches alongside misuse and unethical profiling. ,"The compliance requirements of data minimization force app developers to adopt the following measures:

The review of audit data practices must be conducted to locate and delete methods of unnecessary data collection.

Software developers must establish direct and specific pathways that handling each collected data point to an exact necessary purpose.

The collection of default data should be restricted especially for sensitive information about location and contacts.

The user interface for giving consent should be redesigned to let users view and control their data collection details as well as the reasons behind them.

Organizations need to modify their privacy terms to present essential data handling practices for each purpose using simple language.

Data never stays past these preset time limits until the purpose that generated it becomes obsolete.

The system backend needs to match data reduction requirements so analytics features will deactivate for users who choose to leave the program.",1,"The regulation serves as an important measure to protect consumer privacy through practical policies that are also fair. Companies should only collect data which enables the delivery or maintenance of requested products or services since users request unique services. The regulation establishes clear data collection limits which both constructs user-company trust and prevents overreach except when data is needed for essential delivery or maintenance. By implementing this regulation companies maintain their focus on user needs but they cannot use personal data for unforeseen purposes.

","Assess each feature to determine exactly what personal data is essential to function and cut out any unnecessary data collection.

Revise data flows in the app architecture to ensure they are aligned with specific user-requested services.

Answer the following three questions with this regulation in mind.

Indicate to what extent you agree with the following statement: I believe the data minimization regulation described above should be enacted. 

","Limit data collection to the core service: Developers would need to review what data they collect and ensure it's directly tied to providing or maintaining the specific product or service a user has requested. For example, a food delivery app should only collect location data when it's actively needed to deliver an order — not continuously in the background.

Re-evaluate personalization features: Features like personalized recommendations or promotions may need to be turned off by default or redesigned to only use minimal data. Developers might have to ask for explicit, separate consent if they want to offer these extras, since they’re not required for the core service.

Be more transparent: Apps would need to clearly communicate what data is being collected and why, with stronger justifications tied to the service itself. Vague or broad data purposes wouldn’t be acceptable.

Update backend systems: Many apps are built to collect and store more data than they truly need. Developers may need to re-architect parts of their systems to only request, store, and process the minimum data required.

Train product teams: Teams across the company — from product managers to engineers — would need education on the new limits, so data collection is always tied tightly to user-requested services.",2,"I agree with this version of the data minimization regulation because it clearly limits companies to only collecting data that is necessary to provide the specific service a user has requested. This puts user privacy first and reduces the risk of companies collecting excessive or unnecessary personal information.

In the context of a food and drink app, for example, I think it's reasonable for the app to collect my address and payment information to deliver an order — but it shouldn't collect or use extra data like my location history, contacts, or browsing behavior unless it's absolutely required for the service I asked for.

This kind of regulation helps ensure that companies stay focused on delivering the service rather than using people's data for secondary purposes like targeted advertising or third-party data sharing. It also gives users more confidence that their information won’t be misused.","Great question — this regulation would definitely require some meaningful changes from app developers, especially those who currently collect more data than strictly necessary.

Limit data collection to the core service: Developers would need to review what data they collect and ensure it's directly tied to providing or maintaining the specific product or service a user has requested. For example, a food delivery app should only collect location data when it's actively needed to deliver an order — not continuously in the background.

Re-evaluate personalization features: Features like personalized recommendations or promotions may need to be turned off by default or redesigned to only use minimal data. Developers might have to ask for explicit, separate consent if they want to offer these extras, since they’re not required for the core service.

Be more transparent: Apps would need to clearly communicate what data is being collected and why, with stronger justifications tied to the service itself. Vague or broad data purposes wouldn’t be acceptable.

Update backend systems: Many apps are built to collect and store more data than they truly need. Developers may need to re-architect parts of their systems to only request, store, and process the minimum data required.

Train product teams: Teams across the company — from product managers to engineers — would need education on the new limits, so data collection is always tied tightly to user-requested services.",2,2,,2,1,,2,,66e9b7218ddd7ac02496d379,6806e80aa09de22ad716aebf,6806ea4b9e5881c135ee623b,food and drink,DoorDash

Transparent Communication: Developers will have to update their terms of service and privacy policies to be more explicit about what information is being collected, why it's needed, and how it will be used. Consumers will have to be able to readily read and access such information.

Opt-in and Opt-out Features: To ensure that they only gather necessary data, developers would be required to implement more specified opt-in and opt-out features. For example, users can opt out of certain data collection processes if the information is not necessary for the app's primary function.

Purpose Limitation: Developers may be made to design their apps in a way that data collection is restricted to only what is necessary for the particular service the app provides, and not collecting data for ancillary purposes (e.g., advertising or cross-selling).

Transparency and Consent: Developers may need to revise privacy policies to make it clear why and how data is being collected and for what it would be used. They may also need to provide users with clearer options to consent to data collection.

Developers will likely need to incorporate mechanisms that allow users to opt-out of data collection for secondary uses like marketing or analytics that fall outside the main service or product being used.

They may need to abolish or curtail the collection of data that is not directly linked with the main service provided.

Revising Data Collection Features: Developers ought to re-examine discretionary data collection features, such as analytics or marketing data, that are not required to provide or support the service. This can include giving more apparent opt-in and opt-out choices for non-essential data collection.

Transparency in Data Use: Developers will need to make their privacy policies clearer regarding what data is being gathered, why it is being gathered, and what it will be utilized for.

User Control Over Data: Developers might also need to provide more robust mechanisms for users to control what data is collected. This could include granular privacy settings that allow users to opt-in or opt-out of certain data collections based on their preferences.

The practice makes perfect sense because businesses must limit their collection of customer data to minimal amounts. Data minimization acts as a dual protection mechanism because it decreases security vulnerabilities while constructively strengthening the trust relationship between users and businesses. When I consume products I need to understand how my data is handled since I prefer limited information collection and finite data retention policies. The proposed regulations set necessary boundaries which have been urgently needed for a long time.,The auditing process combined with reevaluation of needed app data should be performed by developers to determine what data is essential for maintaining app functionality. The developers may be required to decrease background data collection as well as shorten user data retention while providing more explicit details about acquired data and its purpose. Users should receive specific requests instead of general consent forms which combine all data permission needed for one unexplained approval page. The beginning effort brings cleaner ethical apps as a final outcome despite an initial investment of time.,1,People possess the right to understand what data companies collect about them while they must trust the data will only serve essential and expected purposes. Companies frequently obtain excessive consumer data that goes beyond their original agreement with users for its use. The new regulation establishes predefined boundaries which establishes customer trust. The regulations do not block businesses from operating efficiently but they protect users from unexpected risks caused by incomplete disclosure of data collection practices.,All data collection from apps must perfectly match user expectations during app usage thus developers need to align their activities with user expectations. Improving app data practices requires two actions. First developers need to lower background data collection volumes and second they must provide thorough reasons for what data collection processes demand as well as delete features which require excessive personal information. Designers of permission requests need to overcome their challenge by elevating their approach to focus on transparent and user-controlled interfaces.,1,The data limitations represent a proper and needed restriction. Most companies gather extensive personal information which exceeds their actual requirements while users generally stay unaware about the amount of data collected. The restriction of data acquisition to essential needs enables companies to deliver services while defending privacy rights of consumers. The restriction establishes a proper equilibrium between corporate invention and user data protection.,Developers of mobile applications need to evaluate their data collection methods to verify that acquired information pertains only to necessary features requested by users. They should restructure their permission request methodology while also minimizing data collection that lacks clear present-day applications. Privacy policy updates together with better explanations about data usage must be implemented by developers.,3,1,,1,1,,2,,66bcffc3e6f77501141b3d0f,6806e80aa09de22ad716aebf,6806ea86cfa53b1623a96b01,shopping,Walmart
